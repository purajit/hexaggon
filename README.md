# Hexaggon

A beautiful, powerful, yet easy-to-use and fully static hex map editor. No servers, no server-side state - just you and your maps, in a plain SVG that you can take anywhere else.

Follows various keybindings and concepts established by programs like Aseprite, fine-tuned for hex editing.
